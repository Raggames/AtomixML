# Neural Network Project

A small neural network/machine learning self-educational project.
The project is made under unity with the goal of understanding machine learning technology.

Features :
* Two trainers : backpropagation learning and genetic learning 
* Vanilla Network : Multilayer perceptron with Dense/FullyConnected layers
* CNN : convolutionnal layers, pooling max/average layers and flatten layers
* Some samples for basic classification and regression : Iris Flower classification, Word language classification, Odd/Even number binary classification
* CNN sample : MNIST classification (achieved 98% accuracy)

Upcoming :
* Biases and debugs for convolutionnal networks
* Recurrent networks
* More CNN samples
* Game AI usages samples of NN
