# Atomix Machine Learning

AML is a personnal and educationnal machine learning project with no purpose of being production ready.
Nevertheless, the quality of the code provided here is meant to be production code.

This project contains implementations of many supervised and unsupervised algorithm.
All the code is made by hand, based on papers, articles, and forums knownledge. 
The goal is to provide a readable implementation for well known algorithm.

Here is the roadmap.

Supervised :
* Feedforward fully connected multilayer perceptrons (stochastic/batched gradient descent training)
* Convolutional Networks (mnist classifier)
* k-Nearest Neighbor
* Support Vector Machine (both linear and kernel based)

Unsupervised :
* K-Mean Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis 
* Spectral Clustering
* Self Organizing Map (Kohonen map)
* Auto-Encoder (vanilla, denoising, variationnal)
* Restricted Boltzman Machine (boolean and continuous)
* GAN

Feel free to download this project to explore the code and to push some issues if you find one !
