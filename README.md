# Neural Network Project

A small neural network testing project (work-in-progress) based on the Microsoft back propagation demo (2013).

The project is made under unity with the goal of understanding machine learning technology.

The neural network can be trained either by backpropagation or by a simple genetic algorithm.

Further improvments are intended : 
-adding a multi-layer fully connected implementation
-a more complex genetic trainer (mutation, crossing DNA)..
-optimizing computations
-testing image denoizing 
-abstracting the training setup as Scriptable Object (accuracy function, heuristics...)
-some custom interface work
-creating a Network Runner (to run tests on a trained network easily)
